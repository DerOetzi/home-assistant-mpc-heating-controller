A Home Assistant custom integration for **model-predictive-control (MPC) room heating** —
one hub per house with the rooms as its sub-entries, combining a self-calibrating grey-box
thermal model with
rate-limited demand control and a purpose-built Lovelace card to operate it.

## Features

- **Grey-box thermal model per room** — heat-loss (`ua_factor`) and thermal-capacity
  (`capacity_factor`) coefficients, learned online from each room's own temperature response
  and continuously self-calibrated while the room is actively heating. See
  [`docs/mpc-guide.md`](docs/mpc-guide.md) for how modes/setpoints combine, what the
  learning-status sensors mean, and how to size a room correctly.
- **Radiator lag and a room observer** — the radiators follow the requested power with a
  lag derived from their water and steel mass, and the room model runs alongside the room,
  correcting itself towards the measurement, so the valve demand counts the heat still in the
  radiators. Lasting gains (neighbours, appliances) end up in the learned heat-loss factor. See
  [`docs/mpc-guide.md`](docs/mpc-guide.md#radiator-lag-and-the-room-observer).
- **Per-TRV emitter modelling** — each thermostatic radiator valve is configured with its
  emitter type (panel radiator or towel radiator), panel radiator type (10/11/21/22/33) and
  dimensions, or a fixed nominal power for towel radiators. The MPC demand is the target
  valve opening (sensor "Target valve opening", entity `heating_demand`); the planner
  expects the heat the radiators give off at that opening, and in relative mode each TRV's
  offset comes from its valve curve: learned, until then the profile's starting value (a
  weighted fallback only for TRVs without either).
- **Comfort / eco / boost / frost-protection mode state machine** — a `select` entity per
  room drives the active mode; `comfort`/`eco` setpoints are independently adjustable
  `number` entities, boost applies a temporary offset on top of comfort, and frost
  protection is the always-available floor.
- **Automatic vs. manually blocked operation** — a `binary_sensor` tracks whether the room is
  following its normal comfort/eco schedule or has been manually overridden; a dedicated
  `button` (and the `heating_controller.unblock` service, targetable at multiple rooms at
  once) clears the override and resumes automatic mode.
- **Rate-limited demand control** — hysteresis, a configurable hold time, and a maximum
  demand step per 5 minutes keep the requested heating power from chattering.
- **Window-contact and room-specific comfort conditions** — open windows suspend demand;
  optional comfort-condition entities (e.g. a desk-plug "home office" signal, a guest
  switch) gate comfort mode per room, in addition to the shared schedule.
- **PV-surplus boost** — an optional binary entity raises the comfort setpoint while solar
  surplus is available.
- **Minimum flow temperature per room** — reports the flow temperature this room's emitters
  need to meet current demand, so a shared heat source's setpoint can be driven by whichever
  room actually needs it (see `sensor.<room>_mindestvorlauftemperatur` /
  `_minimum_flow_temperature`). A surplus gate suppresses the requirement while a room is
  coasting above its setpoint on stored heat, so the value stays usable as a "does this
  room need heat now" signal; `sensor.<room>_hold_flow_temperature` keeps reporting the
  ungated requirement for diagnosis. Hold and recovery flow use the same design spread as
  the valve power the factors are learned from. See [docs/mpc-guide.md](docs/mpc-guide.md).
- **Outdoor temperature outage** — without an outdoor temperature the TRVs get the active
  mode's target as an absolute setpoint and regulate on their own, learning pauses, and
  `binary_sensor.<room>_outdoor_temperature_missing` reports it. The MPC takes over again
  once the value is back. See
  [docs/mpc-guide.md](docs/mpc-guide.md#sensor-reliability).
- **Persisted learning** — each room's learned `ua_factor`/`capacity_factor` survive
  restarts (`homeassistant.helpers.storage.Store`, one file per room) and are removed
  cleanly if the room is deleted from the hub. The admin-only
  `heating_controller.recalibrate` service sets or resets them, and also resets a room's
  learned gains or valve curves.
- **Learning only when gains are small** — learning pauses while the sun is up and for two
  hours after sunset, while the outdoor temperature is missing or the flow temperature has
  had no reading for over 16 minutes, and while a room's optional *block learning* entity is
  on (e.g. an extra heater in that room). The heat-loss factor comes from a heat balance
  over each usable night stretch (four to eight hours) of the requested heating power, the capacity factor from replaying 30-minute
  windows with that power. See [docs/mpc-guide.md](docs/mpc-guide.md#when-the-model-learns).
- **Gains and sun (learning only, not yet used by the control)** — over several nights a
  regression separates a steady gain from the heat-loss factor; every hour a second one
  learns a day profile (8 blocks of 3 hours, workdays and other days apart) and the sun on
  the room's windows, walls and roof surfaces, with irradiance from Open-Meteo. Shown in
  `sensor.<room>_additional_heat`. See [docs/mpc-guide.md](docs/mpc-guide.md#gains-and-sun).
- **Custom Lovelace card** (`custom:heating-controller-card`) — a single card per room
  showing room temperature, configurable header sensors (humidity, CO₂, PM2.5, …), mode
  control, comfort/eco setpoints, boost, room-specific comfort conditions, and a detail
  section with per-TRV state, window contacts, and minimum flow temperature — with a visual
  editor, no YAML required. See [`docs/card-design.md`](docs/card-design.md).
- Fully bilingual UI (English/German), both backend (`strings.json`/`translations/`) and
  frontend card (`translations.js`).

## Installation

### HACS (recommended)

1. HACS → Integrations → ⋮ → Custom repositories
2. Add `https://github.com/DerOetzi/home-assistant-mpc-heating-controller`, category
   "Integration"
3. Install "Heating Controller" and restart Home Assistant

### Manual

1. Copy `custom_components/heating_controller/` into your Home Assistant
   `custom_components/` folder
2. Restart Home Assistant

## Setup

**Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration → Heating Controller** creates the hub,
once per house. It holds everything that applies to the whole house:

1. **Heat pump and house signals** — outdoor temperature sensor, heat source `climate`
   entity (operating state), measured flow temperature sensor, fixed flow threshold and an
   optional threshold entity, optional effective heating curve (for the flow reserve),
   PV-boost entity, house-wide comfort conditions, frost-protection temperature, the flow
   gap after which the heat source counts as unreachable, and the write budget for the heat
   source's cloud (optional entity with the calls left today, reserve kept for required
   writes, own writes per day at most).
2. **Control and design** — design outdoor temperature and system flow/return temperatures
   (used to size the emitter curves), demand-control hysteresis/hold-time/max-step tuning,
   surplus gate, sensor age, the stationary range that decides which factor a measurement
   window trains, target band and TRV target mode.
3. **Sun and workdays** — how the house is turned (the bearing of its north facade, e.g.
   −15° for a house turned 15° west), which way the roof surfaces face and their pitch, and
   an optional workday entity (on = workday; without it Monday to Friday). For the surfaces
   the rooms pick, the hub fetches hourly irradiance from
   [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/): **this sends the latitude and longitude of your
   Home Assistant to api.open-meteo.com.** No room with surfaces, no request.

**Reconfigure** on the hub changes these; all rooms reload.

Then **Add room** on the hub, once per room:

1. **Room name and TRV count** — how many thermostatic radiator valves heat this room.
2. **Per-TRV details** (repeated once per TRV) — the thermostat device, emitter type, and
   (depending on emitter type) panel radiator type/dimensions or nominal power. The
   device's profile supplies everything else, see [Supported devices](#supported-devices).
3. **Sensors and signals** — optional room temperature sensor, window contacts, whether the
   house-wide comfort conditions apply, room-specific comfort conditions, optional entity
   that blocks learning while on.
4. **Boost, PV boost and lead room** — boost enable/offset, PV-boost enable/offset, and
   whether the room is a lead room for the heating limit and/or the flow temperature.
5. **Room design** — design indoor temperature, room heat load, room area and construction
   class (the base heat capacity), and the building surfaces whose sun reaches the room:
   facades with windows, and outer walls or roof surfaces without (a wall with windows
   counts in both).

**Reconfigure** on a room re-runs steps 2–5 pre-filled (the name stays: the room's
learning files are keyed by it). Deleting a room removes its entities and its learning
files.

### Hub entities

The hub's device *Heizung* reports the lead rooms:

- *Lead rooms hold flow temperature* — highest gated hold flow among the heating-limit lead
  rooms (attributes: `room` with the highest value, `rooms`).
- *Lead rooms minimum flow temperature* — highest minimum flow among the flow lead rooms.
- *Lead rooms heating demand* — on while the hold flow reaches the flow threshold;
  unavailable while either is missing.
- *Flow reserve hold* / *Flow reserve minimum* — heating curve minus the two flows above,
  only with a heating curve entity; unavailable while the flow is 0 (all lead rooms in
  their surplus buffer).
- *Irradiance &lt;surface&gt;* — sun on each surface some room uses (W/m², diagnostic),
  with the next 24 hours as attribute `forecast`; unavailable when the last fetch is more
  than three hours old.
- *Heat source reachable* — off once the measured flow temperature has been missing longer
  than the configured gap (diagnostic).
- *Write budget* — cloud calls left today (from the rate-limit entity, else the own daily
  maximum minus own writes); attributes `own_writes_today`, `dropped_today`. Used by the
  flow and hot-water control to stay inside the cloud's daily limit.
- *Heating demand last 24 h* — hours in which *Lead rooms heating demand* was on, kept
  across restarts (the time HA is down counts as no demand).
- *Heating season last demand* — last time those hours were above the hold threshold.
- *Heating season: switch on* / *switch off* — recommendations only, nothing is switched:
  on while the 24 h demand is above the switch-on threshold and the heat source does not
  heat; off while it heats and the hours have not been above the hold threshold for the
  switch-off time. Thresholds are the numbers *Heating season switch-on threshold* (6 h),
  *hold threshold* (2 h) and *switch off after* (48 h). Point a notification automation at
  the two binary sensors.

## Supported devices

A TRV is picked as a device. A device profile for its model then names the entities the
controller uses — found by their unique ID, so renaming them breaks nothing — and the
target temperature range and step:

| Device | Integration | Entities used |
|---|---|---|
| Danfoss Ally (014G2461) | Zigbee2MQTT | climate, `pi_heating_demand` (valve opening), `heat_available`, `adaptation_run_status`, `mounted_mode_active` |
| Danfoss Ally (eTRV0100, eTRV0101, eTRV0103) | ZHA | the same; not yet tested on a real device |

Only devices with a profile can be picked. For another model please
[open an issue](https://github.com/DerOetzi/home-assistant-mcp-heating-controller/issues)
with its manufacturer, model, integration, and the entities the device has (their entity
IDs and unique IDs, e.g. from the device page or `Settings → Entities`). Profiles are YAML
files in `custom_components/heating_controller/device_profiles/`, so a pull request with a
new one is welcome too.

What the controller does with each entity:

- **climate** — reads the TRV's own temperature and writes the target temperature.
- **Valve opening** — the heat the radiator really gives off, see
  [docs/mpc-guide.md](docs/mpc-guide.md#valve-position-the-heat-the-radiators-really-get).
  Each TRV with it also learns its own valve curve (setpoint offset → opening), which
  sets its offset for the target opening in relative mode, see
  [docs/mpc-guide.md](docs/mpc-guide.md#valve-curve).
- **Heat available** — switched on while the heat source delivers heat, so the TRV knows
  whether opening its valve can help.
- **Adaptation status** — while the TRV calibrates its valve, nothing is written to it
  (any write aborts the run), for at most three hours and except for forced frost
  protection; the room does not learn meanwhile. Nor does it learn while the TRV has no
  calibrated valve (status other than `found`).
- **Mounted mode** — while the TRV is in mounting mode the room learns nothing.

A profile may give a starting point for that valve curve, optional, at least two points,
offsets strictly rising and openings never falling:

```yaml
# [setpoint minus TRV reading in °C, valve opening in %]
valve_characteristic_seed:
  - [0.1, 5]
  - [0.6, 45]
  - [1.5, 55]
  - [2.5, 90]
  - [3.0, 100]
```

Until a TRV has learned its curve (and while its curve scatters) the starting value sets its
offsets. Without one a TRV learns its curve from scratch and until then gets a weighted
fallback offset that fits the target opening poorly, so give a profile for a new TRV model a
starting value. The Danfoss Ally profiles carry the values
above, read off one TRV in October 2026; each TRV replaces them with what it learns.

Upgrading from a version that configured TRVs by entity migrates every TRV to its device.
A room with a TRV no profile covers stops with a migration error in the log.

## Dashboard card

Once a room's entities exist, add a `custom:heating-controller-card` to a dashboard (via the
card picker's visual editor, or `type: custom:heating-controller-card` / `device: <device
id>` in YAML). Optional `header_entities` (e.g. a humidity or CO₂ sensor) and
`detail_entities` (arbitrary extra sensors, in addition to the auto-populated TRV/window
rows) are configured entirely through the editor's sortable lists — see
[`docs/card-design.md`](docs/card-design.md) for the full configuration reference.

## Notes

- Each room is a sub-entry of the hub — deleting a room removes only that room's entities and
  learning data, other rooms keep running. Adding, changing or deleting a room reloads all
  rooms.
- Learning (the `ua_factor`/`capacity_factor` self-calibration) only runs while the shared
  heat source is actually calling for heat at or above the configured flow threshold; outside the
  heating season the room simply stops adjusting until it's needed again. Within that time
  it also waits for the sun, the outdoor and flow readings and the room's block entity, see
  [docs/mpc-guide.md](docs/mpc-guide.md#when-the-model-learns).
- The card doesn't care about entity IDs — rename any of a room's entities freely, the card
  keeps working.
- After updating the integration (HACS or manual) and restarting Home Assistant, a normal
  browser reload picks up the updated Lovelace card: its URL carries a hash of the card's
  files, so a changed card is never served from the browser cache.

## Development

```bash
pip install -e ".[test]"
pytest
```

`pytest` runs against a real Home Assistant test harness
(`pytest-homeassistant-custom-component`) plus a QuickJS-based harness that executes the
shipped Lovelace card's JavaScript directly, catching syntax errors that would otherwise
only surface as "custom element not found" in a browser.
